## Features

### Interactive Cube Input

- 2D Net View for simple color input  
- 3D Cube with drag/touch rotation  
- Real-time validation for color correctness  

### Solver Engine

- Kociemba Algorithm for optimal solutions (usually under 25 moves)  
- Fast solving (~1 second)

### Smooth User Experience

- Animations for each move  
- Auto-play solution with pause/resume  
- Dark/Light theme toggle

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Node.js 18+

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dhruvkus-14/cube-solver.git
cd cube-solver
npm install
npm run dev

Then open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.
```
### Production Build

npm run build
npm run preview


###  How to Use
Switch to 2D View to enter colors

Select from the color palette

Ensure each color appears exactly 9 times

Click "Solve" to generate moves

Follow the step-by-step solution in the 3D viewer

### Color Codes
W = White (Up)

Y = Yellow (Down)

R = Red (Front)

O = Orange (Back)

G = Green (Right)

B = Blue (Left)

### Move Notation
R = Right Clockwise

R' = Right Counter-Clockwise

R2 = Right 180°

Other faces follow the same logic: U, D, F, B, L

### Tech Stack
React 18
